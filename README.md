# 📊 TabNet-Based Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates the use of **TabNet**, a deep learning model designed specifically for tabular data. Built and executed in Google Colab, the notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature interpretability using the `pytorch-tabnet` library.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Uses **TabNet** for structured data modeling
- Supports both classification and regression tasks
- End-to-end pipeline: loading, cleaning, training, evaluating
- Visualizations for training loss, accuracy, and feature importance
- Easy to modify for different datasets
